Description: The dataset is hosted by the City of Chicago. The city has an open data platform and they update their information according to the amount of data brought in. The information is derived from inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present. Inspections are performed by staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database, then reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP).

Objective of the analysis was to successively predict whether a food establishment is likely to fail an inspection. I identified the dataset to be a binary classification problem that has an imbalanced class problem, built classification base models and ensembled it to remediate the imbalance in the target class. 

Metrics used to compare the models: Accuracy Score, Cohen’s Kappa Score, Classification reports (Precision, Recall, F1 Score), ROC Curve
